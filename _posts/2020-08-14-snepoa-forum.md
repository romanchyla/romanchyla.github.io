Masslandlords closed down the mailing list used by its members.

The ML forum has been instrumental in organizing resistance against legislative actions during Summer 2020. Unfortunately, ML decided that
it is not in its interest to maintain a state-wide discussion forum. SNEPOA members stepped in to fill the gap and during several days
rolled out a completely new and modern discussing forum.
