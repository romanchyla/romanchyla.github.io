	<p>We have expertise in many domains of law, are not afraid to challenge the state in the court
		and we do not like to see what is happening to both small and large property owners.
	</p>


	<h3>Business</h3>

	<p>We support SNEPOA members by providing them economic advantage, giving them access to discounts and 
		services normally not available to individuals.
